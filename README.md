# Towards a portable human gait analysis & monitoring system

This repository contains the code for our paper "Towards a portable human gait analysis & monitoring system".

## Sections

There are three main part of the project:
1. Matlab code: This is the main code for the paper. It can be found in the directory ``matlab_code_main_algo``
2. Porting the Matlab code to java
3. Finally, the android app.

## How to run the code:

In the folder "matlab_code_main_algo", extract EXL_IMU.zip.

Inside that, EXL_IMU/Experiments_BIMRA/mainDriverCode.m

There are lots of hard-coded path. You need to fix that as per your system. I know there are better ways to handle this.
